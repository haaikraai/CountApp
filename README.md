A very very VERY simple app based on a single componend.

Could be effective.

TODO:
- [ ] Use rxjs observable for the only freaking value yeah.
- [ ] Motherfuck it is uglef
- [ ] Add PWA schematics
- [ ] Let copilot fix my service wroker
- [ ] get persistent storage
- [ ] deploy app



Get observable right
Add pretty colours
Create PWA with service workier
Local storage????

But then, subjects are just so much better and simpler. I'll just use a subject. I get that it is not really required here. This app has **one** **state's** **value** to keep trak of. Call it good habits or who know what when where down the line. Deal with it
